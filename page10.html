                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-title align-left pb-3 display-2">G41 (GELATO)<br></h1>
                <h1 class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text align-left display-7">Gelato is a hybrid crossed from taste-engineered parents Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies and fruity indica Sunset Sherbert. With a balanced, mellow high and a universally appealing flavor profile, this is a great strain for social use. San Francisco creators Cookie Fam Genetics have released multiple numbered phenotypes of Gelato - phenotype #33 has picked up the nickname Larry Bird in reference to the legendary player’s jersey number. This strain has an indica-leaning high and carries a THC composition that ranges from 20% to 25%.<div><br></div><div>Gelato’s buds tend to be small but they have the thick and dense structure characteristic of many indica varieties. This is a strain with immediate visual appeal: bright orange pistils stand out against forest green leaves that are accented by shades of deep purple. The purple hues come about when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold weather in the vegetative stage. Although the buds themselves are sticky, short stalks on the trichomes mean that this strain has a less frosty appearance than many others. Cured properly, flowers of Gelato have a predominant smell of pungent citrus, compliments of fruity parent strain Sunset Sherbert. Notes of yeast and dough can be detected as well. Grinding up or breaking apart the flowers gives off a more herbal, earthy profile. Though it’s thick and lung-expanding, the smoke from Gelato is smooth and leaves behind a soft and creamy sensation -- perhaps going some way towards explaining its name. This is one pungent smoke, and those trying to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.</div><div><br></div><div>Gelato is known to hit users quickly, sometimes taking effect before they’ve had a chance to even exhale. The most striking effect is a sense of altered perception and confusion, forcing smokers to adapt to their newly intensified surroundings. This head rush is met by a palpable body buzz that discourages much activity but still leaves users mobile and not couchlocked. Some describe Gelato as having amplified psychedelic effects like time dilation and sound sensitivity. The floaty and comfortable but still lucid feeling conferred by this strain makes it great for daytime or early evening use. Medically, Gelato has value as a way to treat chronic aches and pains with its powerful numbing effects. Some use it to medicate headaches and migraines as well. This strain’s carefree elevation of mood can also offer temporary relief from the troubling symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Gelato is said to be potent, even for more experienced cannabis users; newcomers should temper their consumption accordingly. That said, because of its lack of intense cerebral effects, this strain is not likely to put users into a deeply paranoid mindset.</div><div><br></div><div>Seeds of Gelato are not commercially available, meaning that prospective growers may need to obtain plant trimmings in order to cultivate clones. If samples of Gelato are obtained, the strain can be particularly difficult to grow and is not necessarily recommended for novices. It can be grown in or outdoors. Outdoor cultivation requires consistently warm and humid conditions around 75 degrees Fahrenheit; indoor grow operations are more easily controlled and can accommodate the medium-height plants. In order to bring out this strain’s full purple potential, growers should expose plants to colder temperatures just before the flowering period to stimulate the aforementioned anthocyanin pigments. Gelato flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. Despite limited information on cultivation of this strain, we know that its Thin Mint and Sunset Sherbert parents have higher than average yields. Finally, this strain’s pungency makes itself known during the growing process -- indoor growers should put odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans in place.</div><div><br></div><div>Gelato has all the smooth and fruity appeal of Sunset Sherbert with the earthy, herbal goodness of Thin Mints. With limited availability and a bold look and taste, this strain falls into an emerging category of west coast craft hybrids that are focused on taste. Carrying multiple desirable traits from its heavily crossbred lineage, Gelato has standout visuals and taste. Its trippy but relaxing vibe makes it a perfect choice for some solo introspection or for chatty socializing.</div></h1>
